# Memory game

This ultimate number memory challenge will put your brain to the test! In this simple yet addictive game, players must remember a sequence of numbers displayed for a second, one at a time, and then input them in the correct order. As the player gets more correct answers, the sequences get longer and more complex, pushing your memory to new limits. Similarly, the sequences will get shorter if the player fails to give the right answer.

This game is perfect for casual gamers, puzzle lovers, and anyone looking to sharpen their mind. Exercising your memory has been shown to provide significant cognitive benefits across all age groups. For children and adolescents, memory training enhances learning abilities, improves academic performance, and strengthens problem-solving skills. In adults, regular memory exercises can improve focus, increase productivity, and boost overall cognitive function. For older adults, studies indicate that engaging in memory activities can slow cognitive decline, reduce the risk of dementia, and improve quality of life. In fact, research shows that consistent cognitive challenges can increase brain plasticity, which helps maintain mental agility throughout life. You can play for as long or as short as you would like, but even if it is just a few minutes every day, you will keep your brain in great shape!

## Features

### Existing features

- __Game area__

    - In this section the user will be able to initiate the game by clicking on the 'Go!' button.
    - When the game starts, the first sequence of numbers will appear (one at a time) on the numbers box. It will only show for 1 second and then disappear. The first sequence only contains one number.
    - The lenght of the sequences will increase as the player gets more correct answers, and will decrease as they get a wrong answer. This is to encourage the users and keep them engaged with the game. The game fits everyone's ability!
    - To help with engagement there is also a catchy sentence at the top.

- __Player answer area__
    - In this area, the player can introduce the number as they remember it and get this number checked against the real number generated by the app. 
    - The input field is disabled while the number is still showing on the number box of the game area. Players will not be allowed to start typing the numbers until the whole sequence is finished. This ensures that the player exercises their memory.
    - Once the number sequence is finished, the input field will get focused, saving the player one click. Similarly, once the player is ready to check if their number is correct, they will be able to do so by either clicking on the 'Check!' button or pressing the Enter key.

    - This is colour-coded to improve user experience.

### Features left to implement

- Different play modes based on ability: The player would need to type the numbers they saw but backwards, or ordering before typing them.
